> FEATURED ALGORITHMS

- Two Sum

> Prompt
******************* PROBLEM 1 ************************
-------- PROBLEM NAME ::: Two Sum

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such
that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and
you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

- Palindrome Number

> Prompt
******************* PROBLEM 2 ************************
--------- PROBLEM NAME ::: Palindrome Number

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same forward and backward.
For example, 13231 is a palindrome while 123 is not.

- Running Sum

> Prompt
******************* PROBLEM 3 ************************

------ PROBLEM NAME ::: Running Sum

Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]…nums[i]).
Return the running sum of nums.

- Remove Element

> Prompt
******************* PROBLEM 4 ************************

------ PROBLEM NAME ::: Remove Element

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place.
The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are
not equal to val. Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get
accepted, you need to do the following things: Change the array nums such that the first k elements
of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not
important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.

- Remove Duplicates From Sorted Array

> Prompt
 `

******************* PROBLEM 5 ************************

------ PROBLEM NAME ::: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such
that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept
the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums. Consider the number of unique elements
of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things: Change the array nums such that
the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially.
The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
